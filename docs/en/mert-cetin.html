    <p>One of the less visible but highly important aspects of Mert Çetin's career is his work with his own developed infrastructures. These infrastructures consist of three main systems: CetinJS, CetinDB, and CetinServer. They are unique infrastructure systems designed by Mert Çetin himself.</p>
    <p>CetinJS is a JavaScript (vanilla js) based infrastructure used primarily for developing mobile and web applications. CetinDB, on the other hand, serves as a database management system (designed to process large and fast data sets) and is used for data storage and access. Finally, CetinServer provides fast and secure management of web servers and APIs.</p>
    <p>These infrastructures play a critical role in bringing Mert Çetin's projects to life. Thanks to the infrastructures he developed, he can manage and develop his projects more efficiently and reliably. Furthermore, these infrastructures are entirely developed by Mert Çetin and are kept closed-source, only being used in his own projects.</p>
    <p>His decision to develop these infrastructures highlights his dedication to technology and his innovative approach. These infrastructures are key elements that make his projects unique and provide a competitive advantage.</p>

    <p>CetinJS is a JavaScript-based framework that, although similar to frameworks like React, Ionic, and others, has a key difference: CetinJS is developed entirely using vanilla JavaScript (pure JS). This framework does not contain any unnecessary commands and is equipped only with efficient commands needed for optimal performance. Every new command added is rigorously tested and approved before being included in the framework. This ensures that performance and reliability are maximized. CetinJS enables users to develop faster and more efficient applications.</p>
